# HerShey Components

### Description

Many common components implemented in pure javascript, use ES5 Obejct API, support: IE9+

I write the project for 3 reason:

- learning pure JavaScript plugin without jQuery.
- practicing CSS
- try `Webpack` for frontend modularization

### Components

- Tooltip
- Progress
- Carousel

still working on it... a github page for it later.
